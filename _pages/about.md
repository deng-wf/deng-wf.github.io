Wenfeng Deng is an Assistant Researcher at the Pengcheng National Laboratory, and also a recipient of the distinguished talent of Pengcheng Peacock Plan. He received his Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering from Central South University (https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in 2024, advised by Prof. Chunhua Yang, and his B.E. in Automation from Central South University in 2019. He also worked as a joint Ph.D. student, supported by the China Scholarship Council (CSC), at the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University (https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) from 2023 to 2024, advised by Prof. Jun Luo.

**Academic Qualifications**
------
- Joint PhD, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 2023-2024 (advised by Prof. Jun Luo)
- PhD, Central South University, China, 2019-2024 (advised by Prof. Chunhua Yang)
- BSc, Central South University, China, 2015-2019 (advised by Prof. Keke Huang)

Research Interests
------
His research interests include **Security & Privacy**, **Large-scale Language Models**, and **Trustworthy Reasoning**. With the widespread deployment of large-scale AI models in critical domains, concerns have emerged regarding their decision-making transparency, reasoning reliability, and overall system robustness. This research focuses on developing trustworthy reasoning mechanisms for large models, emphasizing interpretability, stability, and robustness in complex environments. In parallel, it explores system-level trustworthiness and security techniques for AI systems, including model security evaluation, attack detection and defense, and privacy-preserving mechanisms. The goal is to establish an end-to-end trustworthy AI framework—from model reasoning to system operation—supporting secure and reliable deployment in safety-critical applications.
